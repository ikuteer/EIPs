## Simple Summary
An standard for issuing and trading intellectual property R&D tokens for public benefit - ERC20 extension

(NOT A SECURITY TOKEN)

## Abstract

Builds on the ERC20, ERC721, EIP 1046 (+ZeppelinOS CraftyTokens) and EIP 1047 to provide fungible tokens representing intellectual property ("IP") rights and ownership by embedding a legally enforceable IP license agreement ```tokenURI```.  This standard will enable issuance and trade of fungible IP rights (which have historically been only non-fungible and thereby never issued).  


## Motivation
Traditionally, IP ownership and transfer is non-fungible, enforced by analogue courts, intellectual property offices, notaries, etc. which requires significant overhead.  This limits funding and commerce in IP assets, especially those of high value to society, e.g. rocket science engineering, clinical trials, etc. A legal standard for ```tokenURI``` will provide the infrastructure to support the issuance and global trade of fungible IP assets enforced on-chain.

Leveraging (i) ```tokenURI``` from ERC721 which created metadata identifiers and (ii) EIP 1047 which enables fungibility of ```tokenURI``` for ERC20s, we provide specific format of metadata for issuing and trading fungible IP ownership as tokens.  The metadata includes various identifiers includes among other things a  ```Licese_URI``` - a human readable, legally enforceable IP license agreement. 

This should result in no code changes to the ERC721 standard or ERC20 standard and will serve only to simplify the process of maintaining a legal standard JSON Schema for token metadata, enabling global market penetration

Applications are contemplated below.

## Specification 

```
The metadata extension will be OPTIONAL for ERC20 contracts. This allows your smart contract to be interrogated for details about the IP tokens.

/// @title ERC-20 optional metadata extension
interface TokenMetaData /* is ERC20 */ {

    /// @notice A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given token.
    function tokenURI() external view returns (string);

```

The ```tokenURI``` refers to a legally enforceable IP license agreement (see ```License_URI``` below).    

This is the "ERC 1048" Metadata JSON Schema

```

        }
    }
}

```


A 1048 token represents IP ownership rights as identified in the metadata license.  The metadata license agreement should be part of the IP token issuance documentation, thereby enabling the initial set of buyers (from the issuer) to click a check box (standard for token sales) agreeing to the license terms.  On the secondary market, transacting in a 1048 token is consent to the legal agreement in the metadata, thereby enabing IP transactions to occur between two parties using the Ethereum blockchain for enforcement as opposed to lawyers, admins and courts. This is similar to markets trading contracts for commodities.  

There is no limitation on transfer other than requiring the sender to have a sufficient balance.


## Rationale

The Ethereum blockchain provides for atomic provenance and fungibility enforced on-chain, across jurisdictions.  The IP license agreement outlining IP rights is a file on IPFS with a certain hash that can be viewed through a ```URI```.
The developer community supports use of the ```tokenURI``` metadata through ERC721 - Crypto Kitties, ```LAND``` in Decentraland, etc. yet these distinguishable properties, like traditional IP are non-fungible.  This proposal gives IP ownership rights the ability to be fungible, secure, legally sound and atomically tracked through building on ZeppelinOS standards.  Like traditional ERC20 tokens with a fungible `supply`, for the first time, IP rights can become fungible.

Developers, scientists and all interested parties will be able to confidently understand how to issue and trade in IP tokens on a global basis with minimal friction.  This is expected to (i) increase human bandwidth for innovation and (ii) provide a new asset class - fungible IP.

One JSON schema standard will allow for simple maintenance of this critical schema enabling fungible IP markets.

Fungible Token Identifiers

Every 1048 is identified by a unique contract address (after it is deployed).  This identifying contract address SHALL NOT change for the life of the contract. The contract address will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified fungible identifier for a specific copyright asset on an Ethereum chain. 

Transfer Mechanism
ERC-20


## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP is fully backwards compatible as its implementation simply extends the functionality of ERC20 tokens and is optional.

## Test Cases
IP based in scientific information of value e.g. clinical trials, etc.  Other use cases may include rocket science engineering, entertainment licensing, consumer applications, software development, etc.
